Problem Statement

Public governance bodies receive thousands of citizen grievances every day, covering issues such as civic infrastructure, sanitation, public safety, utilities, healthcare, education, and administrative delays. These complaints are often unstructured, manually reviewed, and slow to resolve, leading to backlogs, poor accountability, and citizen dissatisfaction.
There is a pressing need for an intelligent, transparent, and automated grievance redressal system that can streamline complaint submission, assignment, tracking, and resolution.

Project Overview

The AI-Powered Citizen Grievance Redressal System is a role-based web platform designed to digitize and automate the complete grievance lifecycle.
The system ensures faster resolution, proper accountability, and transparent governance by enabling structured workflows across three dedicated portals:

Citizen Portal – Raise and track grievances

Admin Portal – Manage, categorize, and assign grievances

Field Officer Portal – Resolve assigned grievances and update status

This system eliminates manual routing, reduces delays, and ensures that grievances are addressed by the correct authority based on location and issue type.

System Workflow

Citizen raises a grievance with issue details, category, and location.

Admin reviews the grievance, validates it, and assigns it to the appropriate Field Officer based on region and department.

Field Officer works on the issue, updates progress, and marks it as resolved.

Admin verifies the resolution and closes the grievance.

Citizen can track live status updates throughout the entire process.
